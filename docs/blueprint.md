## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4F46E5) for a sophisticated and tech-oriented feel. It is used sparingly for highlights.
- Background color: Dark charcoal gray (#1E293B) to provide a modern, clean, and focused backdrop, offering excellent contrast for content.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E0E7FF) as a secondary accent to complement the indigo, used in small amounts for buttons and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern, neutral and objective aesthetic, perfect for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist line icons for a clean and modern look. Icons should be in a light color, providing enough contrast against the dark background, but not overpowering it.
- Implement a full-width layout with a maximum container width for comfortable reading. Use a grid system to structure content effectively, with ample spacing between elements. Focus on creating a balanced visual hierarchy to guide the user through the content.
- Subtle transition animations on hover states and when transitioning between sections to add a layer of polish without being distracting. Use smooth, gentle easing for a professional feel.
